## This folder contains code for Benchmark calculations and Cost Components calculations.

### This script contains code for getting TWAP and VWAP trades as well as simulating these trades through benchmarks to get values for costs (Slippage and Market Impact)

You can use cost components for setting up rewards for your model as well. Feel free to play around with this script and make any edits / additions as required.
